              I, <span className="font-semibold">{clientName || "_______________"}</span>, understand that the massage I receive is provided
              for the basic purpose of relaxation and relief of muscular tension. If I experience any pain or discomfort during this
              session, I will immediately inform the therapist so that the pressure and/or strokes may be adjusted to my level of
              comfort.
            </div>

            <p>
              I further understand that massage should not be construed as a substitute for medical examination,
              diagnosis, or treatment and that I should see a physician, chiropractor or other qualified medical specialist for any
              mental or physical ailment that I am aware of.
            </p>

            <p>
              I understand that massage therapists are not qualified to perform spinal or skeletal adjustments, diagnose, prescribe,
              or treat any physical or mental illness, and that nothing said in the course of the session given should be construed as such.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because massage should not be performed under certain medical conditions, I affirm that I have stated all my known
              medical conditions, and answered all questions honestly. I agree to keep the therapist updated as to any changes in my
              medical profile and understand that there shall be no liability on the therapist's part should I fail to do so.
